  <title>CSS QNA Test</title>
  <!--A very simple QNA/Question And Answer test...
      A drop down menu list is displayed offering 4 maths questions:
      What is 3+3?
      What is 3-3?
      What is 3x3?
      What is 3/3?
      ...when the question is clicked on 4 different multiple choice answers appear for the user to select from.
      The correct answer when hovered over with the mouse...
      is displayed as both 'center aligned'/and, using a different 'background/foreground' colours.
      ------
      I must confess that I'm not entirely happy with this program...;
      as it makes the answer far too obvious whenever one moves the mouse over the questions;
      perhaps, it would have been slightly better if I had used Javascript's: onclick() event, instead.
 
      However, I've not entirely given up, yet...; 
      as, I'm sure, it's possible to do this effectively using just CSS alone;
      but, right now, I'm just not sure how...?
