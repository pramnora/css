## Introduction

HTML/HyperText MarkUp Language, is the **base** language used to create web pages with. It is mostly concerned with text presentation/but, also, includes such things as: tables/iFrames/forms/links/too, graphics/audio/video files/-etc.; it also contains META content (the non-visible part of the web page), too...such as which particular version of HTML the web pages uses/and, so on; and, can link to Javascript/CSS files/-etc.     

CSS/Cascading Style Sheet code, is a very powerful compliment to HTML code...so, much so that, now-a-days, seldom does one find hardly any HTML web page...that doesn't include some CSS code to accompany it.

- HTML code, is used just to render, mostly, 'plain text'.  

- CSS code, is used to decorate that text...position text: left/right/center; colour text in...re-size text...give the text a spectic font face: arial/verdana/sans-serif/-etc...create text effects: bold/underline/italic...highlight text/-etc. CSS, can also be used to create such things as page rows/columns...and, position these exactly as the web page designer themselves pleases.  

In short, and in summary...without CSS being available...; then, HTML web pages would tend to look very 'boring', indeed. Myself, I can hardly think of 'one' well known/or, famous company web site...that doesn't employ both the use of HTML/CSS, together...plus, Javascript (which adds interactivity); thus, learning to use both HTML and CSS together...I would say is absolutely *essential* learning if you wish to learn how to write/design/build web pages truly most effectively.

The good news is...because CSS has been around for an awfully long time...; therefore, there are helpful 'teach yourself CSS' resources located all over the internet; whether those resources are 'text based'/or else, 'video based', instead; too, there are books you can buy/library books you can borrow/-etc.
