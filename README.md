## Introduction

CSS/Cascading Style Sheet code, is a very powerful compliment to HTML/HyperText MarkUp Language code...so, much so that, now-a-days, seldom does one find hardly any HTML web page...that doesn't have some CSS code to accompany it.

- HTML code, is used just to render, mostly, 'plain text'.  

- CSS code, is used to decorate that text...position text: left/right/center; colour text in...re-size text...give the text a spectic font face: arial/verdana/sans-serif/-etc...create text effects: bold/underline/italic...highlight text/-etc. CSS, can also be used to create such things as page rows/columns...and, position these exactly as the web page designer pleases.  

In short, and in summary...without CSS being available...; then, web pages would mostly tend to look very 'boring', indeed. Myself, I can hardly think of 'one' well known/or, famous company web site...that doesn't employ the use of CSS; thus, learning to use both HTML and CSS...I would say is essential learning if you wish to learn how to write/design/build web pages truly most effectively.
