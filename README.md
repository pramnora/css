## Introduction

CSS/Cascading Style Sheet code, is a very powerful compliment to HTML/HyperText MarkUp Language code...so, much so that, now-a-days, seldom does one find hardly any HTML web page...that doesn't have some CSS code to accompany it.

- HTML code, is used just to render, mostly, plain text.  
- CSS code, is used to decorate that text...position text: left/right/center; colour text in...re-size text/-etc.
