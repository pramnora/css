## Introduction

CSS Animations, is a tremendously *exciting* field in web page programming;      
and, I find myself being enormously attracted to it.  

The main reason why is because the code is very 'light and compact'...;  
because, instead of using heavily memory intensive 'graphic files:  
[.jpg]/[.gif]/[.png]/[.mov]/[.mp4]/-etc.;        
all of which can be 'slow' to both download/run...;         
CSS Animations, merely uses some coded text(which is a whole lot less memory intensive);  
thus, is much quicker to download/run.
