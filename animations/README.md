## Introduction

CSS Animations, is a tremendously *exciting* field in web page programming;      
and, I find myself being enormously attracted to it.  

The main reason why is because the code is very 'light and compact'...;  
because, instead of using heavily memory intensive 'graphic files: [.jpg]/[.gif]/[.png]/-etc.;      
which can be slow to download/run...;       
it just merely uses some coded text(which is far less memory intensive).
