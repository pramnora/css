## Introduction

CSS Animations, is a very exciting field;   
I find myself being enormously attracted to it.  

The main reason why is, the code is very 'light and compact'...;  
because, instead of using 'graphic files'...  
which are really heavy memory wise/and, therefore, slow to download/run;     
it just merely uses some coded text(which is far less memory intensive).
